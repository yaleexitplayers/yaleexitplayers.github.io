									No experience is necessary to audition! In fact, most of us didn't do improv before joining Exit! Before auditions in the fall, we have a recruitment show and workshops. Read below to learn more about the audition process, and check in next fall to keep updated with our events.

									<h3>Workshop 1: Monday, 9/2, 7:30-9:00pm (meet in front of WLH)</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									Before auditions, we hold a couple hour-long workshops to teach you the basics of long-form improvisation. If you've never done improv before, this is the perfect way to get your feet wet. (Don't worry – we won't throw you into the deep end. You'll develop a toolbox of improv skills, bit by bit, until everyone is ready to do fully improvised scenes.) If you have done improv before, this is a great opportunity to brush up, and to see how Exit does it. Plus, it'll be a total blast!

									<h3>Workshop 2: Thursday, 9/5, 6:30-8:00pm (meet in front of WLH)</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									Okay, so you missed our last workshop, but don't despair: we have another one! Our workshops are <b>no-stress</b> and completely 100% <b>non-evaluative</b>: you're not being judged at all. We really recommend coming to one or both of the workshops before auditions. We try hard to make them super-helpful (and fun)!

									<h3>Recruitment Show: Friday, 9/6, 9:00-10:00pm @ Hopper Cabaret</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									This is the only full-length show we'll do before tapping our new frexies (First-Year Exit Players). Come see what we're all about – and bring your friends! Seeing the recruitment show is a great way to decide if Exit's style of improv is right for you.

									<h3>Auditions</h3>
								</header>
								<h4>Audition Slots (meet in front of WLH):</h4>
								<h5>Sunday: 11:00am-1:00pm, 1:00pm-3:00pm, 4:00pm-6:00pm</h5>
								<h5>Monday: 7:00pm-9:00pm, 9:00pm-11:00pm</h5>
								<br>
								<br>
								<p>
									You can come to any one of our five audition slots to try out for the Exit Players. Exit's auditions are fun and very low-stress (especially if you've gotten the hang of things at our workshops). At the audition, we'll lead you and your fellow auditionees through a series of fun exercises and scenes. Everything's made up, so there's no need to prepare anything beforehand!
