									The Yale Exit Players might be based at Yale, but we love bringing improv to audiences all around the country! We go on two tours a year (one in early January and another mid-March) where we spend a week in a new city performing and teaching improv at schools, theaters, youth centers, and anywhere improvisers or fans gather. If you're based in the Northeast, or in a place where we're touring this year, we'd love to hear from you! See below for examples of what we do and places we've been, and get in touch with us if you're interested in us coming to your school or workplace.

									<h3>Shows</a></h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									 We do long form and experimental improv. We have about eight on-campus shows per year, in addition to off-campus collaborations with other groups. We follow established forms, including the Harold, Armando, and Close Quarters, and we are always looking to try out new fun styles.
								</p>
								<p>
									 As an experimental improv group, we are open to new show ideas! In the past, we have worked with the Yale University Art Gallery to perform improv inspired by the artwork in the museum, as well as the Yale Club of New Haven to teach children about historical figures in the Grove Street Cemetery.
